This folder is intended to hold demo assembly (and potentially binary) versions of programs that could be used to demonstrate our GPU.

The assembly conforms to the format used by the provided simulator (which doesn't necessarily conform to other specs - ie. it doesn't support quads, and vertices are in clockwise, rather than counterclockwise, order)
