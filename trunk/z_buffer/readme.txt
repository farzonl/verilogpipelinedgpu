z_buffer Folder Readme File
----------------------------

This folder contains some minor code modifications done while brainstorming how to implement the z-buffer check before writing a pixel.  The main file to check is probably DE1_Default.v.

Note that the code in here does not actually work, but it may be useful in figuring out control signals necessary to fully add z-buffer support.
