Java assembler for our FPGA GPU.
Files in this directory are part of an Eclipse project.
As of April 19, probably not 100% correct, but pretty close.

Command-line parameters are as follows:

	input_file output_file

-input_file is the input assembly file
-output_file is the file you would like to have the hexadecimal instruction values written to

For example, you could run the program with the following parameters:

	test_cases/test2_1.s test_cases/test2_1.hex
